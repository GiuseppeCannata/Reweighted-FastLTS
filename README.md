# Reweighted-FastLTS

<p>
The Reweighted-FastLTS is a robust regression algorithm that allows you to detect anomalous observations.
A Python <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ltsfit/">implementation of FastLTS</a> by Michele Cappellari is based on the analysis of datasets with 3 predictors. Starting with the latter and after Prof. Peter Rousseeuw's lessons at the BigDat2020 winter school I implemented a python version of the Reweighted-FastLTS.
